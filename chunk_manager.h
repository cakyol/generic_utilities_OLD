 *
 * This is a chunk manager which manages a many same sized chunks, 
 * dynamically allocated & freed.  It is like malloc & free but much
 * faster since most chunks are pre-allocated and disbursing them
 * is therefore quite fast.  Comparing the speed to malloc/free,
 * for chunk sizes of up to about 64 bytes, the performance is up
 * to about 2.5 times faster.  For chunk sizes above 64 bytes, it is
 * up to about 7-8 times faster.
 *
 * There is one VERY important requirement of this implementation.
 * It is the fact that when this dynamically grows, the addresses of
 * all previously allocated chunks MUST stay the same.  Therefore,
 * a simple realloc scheme could not be used since at some point,
 * a realloc may change the adresses completely, violating this
 * principle.  The reason this is required is that if the user
 * caches the pointer values of these chunks, they must never change.
 *
 * To be able to provide the above, the concept of a 'chunk group' is
 * defined where all the addresses in that group always stay the same.
 * In each group, a big block of malloced area is divided into many chunks
 * and are maintained.  If chunks are all used up and more is needed,
 * we cannot simply realloc the block and expand it.  This is because
 * the realloc may change the addresses and this would not work.  To
 * provide this expansion requirement, an expanding list of chunk groups
 * is therefore maintained.  When all the chunks in a group are exhausted,
 * a new group is created.  When a new chunk group is created, all the
 * available chunk addresses are added to the list of free chunks in the
 * main chunk manager structure.  This causes the chunk manager to
 * pause and add new chunks to the free chunks stack when the current
 * set of chunks are depleted.
 *
 * A bigger challenge is when 'trimming' the structure is needed.
 * This is when the user decides that there are a lot of free chunks
 * around which are not needed and may have to be returned back to
 * memory.  When this is requested, all the groups are scanned and
 * for the ones who have all their chunks unused, each chunk is
 * removed off the free chunks stack and the entire group deleted.
 * This can be a bit tricky and time consuming and is therefore not
 * automatically performed but left to the user as to when it needs
 * to be run.
