 * This is an object which assists creation & parsing of tlvs.
 * The tlv manager can be 'attached' to a buffer and it proceeds
 * from there.  It can either parse an already existing list of tlvs
 * in the buffer OR it can assemble and build a list of tlvs into
 * the buffer.  When the tlv manager is initialised, the buffer 
 * to be 'associated' with is specified as a parameter.  All further
 * tlv operations take place on that buffer thereafter.
 *
 * Note that the tlv manager always terminates a tlv by a type of
 * of 0xFFFFFFFF.  Parsing will stop as soon as this 'type' is 
 * encountered.  If the tlv manager is populating the tlvs, it
 * will insert this type to the end of the tlv list.  If it is
 * parsing an existing list of tlvs in the buffer, it will hunt
 * for this to find the end of the list.
